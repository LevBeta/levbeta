Hello! I'm **Levbeta**, but you can call me **Beta**. Despite what you might think, my name is related to Î² ([beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)) in finance, not the other "beta". I'm a passionate developer currently building my personal high-frequency trading (HFT) infrastructure, primarily using Rust.
